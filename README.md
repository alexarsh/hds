## Project status

The project was focused on the working main functionality, unit tests coverage and deployment

Things left to be done are:
1. Each service health check should run in itâ€™s own task. When there are a lot of services to check, the task becomes very large and it's not good.
2. Invoking health check url should have some spinning wheel shown to the user when the UI will be developed
3. Current health check is very primitive and can use additional info from the urls to perform a drill down in dashboards reports, for example.
4. Old health checks should be automatically deleted
5. Every api call has a timeout of 5 seconds. When there will be a lot of services, the timeout, number of gunicorn processes and machine resources should be taken into consideration.
